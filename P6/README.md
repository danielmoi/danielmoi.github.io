# Project Overview

This project involved using the Jasmine library to build a test suite for a web application that displays RSS feeds. This project was built for the Front End Web Development Nanodegree with Udacity.

I added the extra functionality of a specific header color for each news feed (that corresponds to that organisations' branding). This allowed me to implement additional specs for my test suite!


# Lists of tests
*New tests in italics!*
#### RSS Feeds
1. Are defined
1. Have a URL defined, and that the URL is not empty
1. Have a name defined, and that the name is not empty
1. *Have a color defined, and that the color is valid*

#### The Menu
1. Is hidden by default
1. Should change visibility when the menu icon is clicked

#### Initial Entries
1. When loadFeed function is called and completes it work, there is at least a single .entry element within the .feed container

#### New Feed Selection
1. When new feed is loaded, that the content actually changes
1. *When new feed is loaded, that the header color changes*
